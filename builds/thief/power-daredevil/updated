<Specialization name="Daredevil" text="Power Daredevil"/> has great sustained DPS, great burst on stacked trash mobs, good single target burst, brings excellent crowd control and offers <Effect name="stealth"/>, which paired with top tier mobility thanks to <Skill id="13025"/>, <Skill id="13002"/> and <Skill id="13064"/> can enable many fast skips in T4s. <Specialization name="daredevil"/> has a very simplistic rotation, which makes it fairly easy to play, but due to initiative and energy management, <Specialization name="daredevil"/>  becomes quite hard to master.

In fractals <Specialization name="daredevil"/> falls behind other classes for several reasons. First would be <Trait id="1268"/>, which forces <Specialization name="daredevil"/> to constantly attack from behind or flank, which in some scenarios is not possible. (Note: with latest balance patch, keen observer got buffed, and with at least 204 Agony Resistance thief no longer need to flank). Next would be <Trait id="1257"/>, which depending on your group composition you may not receive as much of a damage bonus as you would in raids where 10 players allow for more condis to be on the boss. Finally keep in mind that because of <Trait id="2047"/>, you may be pushing your teammates on fractals with <Instability name="Social awkwardness"/> instability into deadly zones.

The build benefits from slaying potions such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

<Card title="Tips">
<Skill id="30597"/> (Staff 5) is worth using if you can hit 4 or more mobs at once. Especially since staff autoattacks and <Skill id="29911"/> can only hit 3 targets. So on big groups of trash mobs you should just spam <Skill id="30597"/> and then finish them with <Skill id="13085"/>.

<Skill id="13041"/> (Shortbow 2) is an amazing shortbow skill. It is a blast finisher with a low initiative cost. Use it to blast <Boon name="Might"/> and <Effect name="Stealth"/> with fire and smoke fields respectively.

Keep in mind you can precast skills like <Skill id="13037"/>, <Skill id="13082"/> or <Skill id="13132"/> and take the mistlock singularity to refresh their coolddown. For example: Precast <Skill id="13082"/>, take mistlock, cast <Skill id="13132"/>, and swap to <Skill id="13082"/> again.

Although <Specialization name="daredevil"/> doesn't have access to  <Boon name="Superspeed"/> for <Item id="85244"/> or <Item id="49940"/>, it still can execute many skips for your party in T4s.
